# ArchLinux ARM
- Others have attempted and succeeded on this; but the process from which to do it has since become outdated...
# Links
- Some links are below;
-- https://github.com/reey/PKGBUILDs
---- This repo contains PKGBUILDs for a mainline kernel
---- Additionally it made some releases of mainline kernels before going inactive
-- https://github.com/RaumZeit/LinuxOnAcerCB5-311
---- A really bad shell script to install ArchLinux ARM to $1 or the drive
---- The script is extremely outdated and I would NOT recommend using it
-- https://github.com/reey/LinuxOnAcerCB5-311
---- A fork of the above script that is ~10% better; would still not recommend however
---- Although this repo contains a uboot room as well as a uboot install script which are helpful for those attempting uboot
-- http://www.clifford.at/blog/index.php?/archives/131-Installing-Ubuntu-on-an-Acer-Chromebook-13-Tegra-K1.html
---- The orginal writeup; Everything here is far too out of date to be of much use
-- https://github.com/RaumZeit/PKGBUILDs/tree/master/alarm/gpu-nvidia-tegra-k1
---- A PKGBUILD for the closed source GPU drivers; too out of date to be used anymore; needs heavy work
-- http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ronny/acer-cb5-311.html
---- Another writeup based off RaumZeit/LinuxOnAcerCB5-311; useless other then some tibits about sound and drivers
-- https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=12185
---- The orginal forum, features alot of info not found elsewhere
-- https://github.com/LordRafa/ALARMOnTegraK1
---- A mostly up to date writeup on alarm for the jetson k1; SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR NYAN BOARDS
