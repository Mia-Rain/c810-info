- Thanks goes out to the following users;

---- For basically all fixes;
---- After reading over the forum and everything for ArchLinuxARM
---- Their imagebuilder and kernel repos had fixes for everything
---- I can't say it enough; basically nothing would work if it weren't for the progress of hexdump0815
---- Whoever you are, thank you. I have spent years trying to make my Nyan-big Chromebooks work with native linux
---- And was always so close yet so far; with your work it has been achived.
