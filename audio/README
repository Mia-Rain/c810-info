# Audio
- Getting sound working from a Linux setup
## ucm2
-- Others from the forum have mentioned that their sound seemingly stopped working one day
-- I can't find the source of why for this; but hexdump0815 has a fix again
### Installing
-- https://github.com/hexdump0815/imagebuilder/tree/main/systems/chromebook_nyan/extra-files
---- Copy all files from etc/ and usr/share/alsa/ucm2/ from the above repo to your system
---- from there a normal `alsactl restore` on boot + a login manager with pulseaudio
---- seems to make everything work perfectly (!!!)
